      “ Hello, this is your former president, Barack Obama, and I just want to
      tell you I know how to beatbox! With a little bit of... [beatbox noises]
      Yeah! [continues beatboxing] ” ―Obunga's proximity audio
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Obunga</em> was one of the various nextbots that hunted down players
      in Nico's Nextbots. He was released in the initial release. It was
      formerly found in Nico's Mall. He spawned by the mini white walls on the
      third floor.

    <h2><b>Appearance</b></h2>
    <p>
      Obunga is a distorted version of former U.S. President Barack Obama,
      having swarthy brown skin, gray-brown hair and black eyes. As well as
      sporting a white shirt with a light brown and blue necktie, over a formal
      dark blue suit with an American flag clip. In this nextbot counterpart, he
      has very large eyes and a large jaw and his face resembles the creatures
      that resemble mutated cockroaches shown in the manga and live adaption of
      Terra Formars.

    <h2><b>Origin</b><h2>
    <h3><b>Image<b></h3>
      <p>Although the exact origin is unknown, the 
        first archive of Obunga is from July 24, 2013, where an image of Obunga was posted
         on the /tv/ board of 4chan. Obunga picked up popularity during June 2018 due to multiple 
         users posting Obunga memes on Instagram. Obunga regained popularity of the summer of 2022 
         when it was first used as a bot in the NextBot chase mod from Garry's Mod.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Audio</b></h3>
        <p>The audio is from a video called "Obama Beatbox" by professional beatboxer,
           verbalase. The original video has been made private, but there have been 
           many reuploads of the video, such as one on the Roblox Audio
           Library that was presumably used in Nico's Nextbots.
          The jumpscare audio is from an emoji screaming while fading away.</p>
